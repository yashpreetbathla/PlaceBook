// combines both <label> and <input>, also has built in user input validation
// we also have 3rd party libraries like Formik, which can be used in react to get form functionality for free, with input validations

import React, { useReducer, useEffect } from 'react';
// when we have two kind of connected states, the validitiy depends on input value then using useReducer hook is better
// useReducer allows to manage state in a component and also gives a function we can call to update the state and rerender the component
// but difference btw useState and useReducer is, with useReducer we can manage more complex state with ease, can write some logic that runs whenever state is changed and do complex updates than just set a new value

// useEffect allows to run some logic when some dependency is changed, we can also used it to run something after the first render as we didi it in google maps
// we can also use it to run some logic whenever the input value or validity changes, becoz they change together and send back the new value back to the NewPlace component

  // current state i.e. inputReducer and dispatch function, in this way we can dispatch actions to the reducer function, which will return new state which will update inputState and rerender the component
  // function which recieves a action which we can dispatch, and recieves the current state
  // we update the current state based on the action recieved, return the new state, useReducer() takes the new state and give it back to the component and rerender everything
